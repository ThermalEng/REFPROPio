# REFPROPio
The refprop program offers a dynamic library for other programs. However, poor encapsulation and lots of pointers made it powerful in functions and difficult when you want to use it. So a new library is being built for easier use. The library is a standard dll  file written in c whitch can be called conveniently by many other languages.
